In this Microsoft Power BI project, a test dataset sample was used to create an interactive Human Resource Dashboard in Power BI. 

Some of the insights captured by the dashboard:
- Total Number of Employees
- Total Number of Active Employees
- Total Employees who have left the company (Attrition Rate)
- Percentage of Attrition Rate overall
- Percentage of Attrition Rate among departments
- Employee Gender analysis
- Employee Age Group analysis
